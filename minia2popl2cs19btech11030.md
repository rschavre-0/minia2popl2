# MINI ASSIGNMENT 2

auto keyword:-auto is a C++11/C++14 keyword used way to create a variable of the appropriate type, based on a given expression.
use of class:-Class is made up of methods and data members. It is encapsulation that a single unit class holds methods and data members.
modularity using objects:-using objects in one file and definition in other file makes the code nice,easy to read, and modular.
modularity using namespaces:-Namespaces represents a good solution to modularize the application.
use of standard c++ libraries:-example: usage of string library for c++.
usage of iostream is forbidden.
avoid inline keyword in class:-Don’t use inline when defining a function in a class definition.A member function defined in a class definition is implicitly inline, so don’t put the inline keyword in this case.
class hierarchy:-I found the inheritance list of llvm on https://llvm.org/doxygen/hierarchy.html . Inheritance is an important concept in OOP languages.It is a mechanism to derive a class from another class for a hierarchy of classes that share a set of attributes and methods
Constructor:-A class constructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class. A constructor will have exact same name as the class and it does not have any return type at all, not even void. Constructors can be very useful for setting initial values for certain member variables.
Destructor:-A destructor is a special member function of a class that is executed whenever an object of it's class goes out of scope or whenever the delete expression is applied to a pointer to the object of that class. A destructor will have exact same name as the class prefixed with a tilde (~) and it can neither return a value nor can it take any parameters. Destructor can be very useful for releasing resources before coming out of the program like closing files, releasing memories etc.
usage of virtual methods and abstract classes:-A virtual method is a type of method where the actual method calls depends on the runtime type of the underlying object.Abstract classes are classes that contain one or more abstract methods. An abstract method is a method that is declared, but contains no implementation. Abstract classes cannot be instantiated, and require subclasses to provide implementations for the abstract methods.
usage of template:-In file we can see it usage https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/main/llvm/include/llvm/Support/GenericDomTree.h .Templates are the foundation of generic programming, which involves writing code in a way that is independent of any particular type. A template is a blueprint or formula for creating a generic class or a function. The library containers like iterators and algorithms are examples of generic programming and have been developed using template concept.
usage of  explicit keyword:-Using the explicit keyword as prefix to the constructor prevents the compiler from using that constructor for implicit conversions.
usage of operator overloading:-c++ has feature that allows user to overload existing operators for user-defined meaning.Operator overloading is special case of polymorphism. Polymorphism is a key concept in OOP languages.Polymorphism is ability of object to take in multiple forms.
usage of enumeration:-An enumeration is a user-defined data type that consists of integral constants. To define an enumeration, keyword enum is used.
usage of iterators:-iterators is defined in the std::iterator. llvm-project/llvm/include/llvm/Support/LineIterator.h uses this iterator in class line_iterator.It is also easy to see that line_iterator derives properties from std::iterator.This is also an example of inheritance.
usage of vectors:-C didn't have any standard vector implementation.But c++ does have it in std::vector Vectors are same as dynamic arrays with the ability to resize itself automatically when an element is inserted or deleted, with their storage being handled automatically by the container. Vector elements are placed in contiguous storage so that they can be accessed and traversed using iterators. 
Exception handling:-C++ exception handling is built upon three keywords: try, catch, and throw.All standard exceptions defined in std::exception.
